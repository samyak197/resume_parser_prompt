I am going to provide you with my resume text, and I need you to convert it into a structured JSON format.
The JSON should contain sections for Contact Information, Profile, Skills, Education, Extracurricular Activities, Hobbies, Certifications/Courses, Experience, and Projects. 
Please ensure that each section is accurately represented in the JSON format.
